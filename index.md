This is the [University of Manchester's](http://www.manchester.ac.uk) course on programming in R from [Research IT](http://www.itservices.manchester.ac.uk/research/).  

The course is currently under development, and will be piloted in Spring 2018, before being offered as one of [Research IT's training courses](http://www.staffnet.manchester.ac.uk/staff-learning-and-development/academicandresearch/practical-skills-and-knowledge/it-skills/research-computing/research-courses/).   

> ## Prerequisites
>
> You should be able to:
> * Use R to load delimited data
> * Manipulate tibbles or data frames
> * Subset vectors
>
> The Research IT course [R for data analysis](https://uomresearchit.github.io/r-tidyverse-intro/) covers these prerequisites, using the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org).  
> We will be using the tidyverse in parts of this course, so familiarity with its main packages (pipes, readr, dplyr) would be useful.
